# Framework for developing a React app

When building a React app, there is a series of steps to follow in order to make the entire process more efficient:

1. Break the app into components
2. Build a static version of the app
3. Determine what should be stateful
4. Determine in which component each piece of state should live 
5. Hard-code initial states
6. Add inverse data flow
7. Add server communication
